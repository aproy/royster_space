Hello! I am Alex Royster and I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I work at Mytech Partners, a Managed Service Provider. I am interested in all things IT and love learning about new technologies.

I manage servers, network devices and workstations. I primarily work on Windows servers, managing Group Policy, Exchange, File Services and other domain functions. I also support various 3rd party server solutions and applications. The majority of the servers I manage run on VMWare hosts, but I manage some that are running Hyper-V. Increasingly I am managing more Office 365 tenants via the portal and PowerShell and recently gained Office 365 MCSA certification.

On the networking side, I work with primarily with SonicWall, Cisco and Watchguard firewalls, routers and switches. I also managed a number of Wireless Controllers including Xirrus, Ubiquiti and Meraki, as well as legacy Cisco controllers.

I enjoy learning and am always working on new certifications. I am currently working on Cisco Routing and Switching and Xirrus Certified Wireless Professional. Soon, I will be starting a course for VMWare Certified Professional which I am looking forward to.

Here are my current certifications:

* Microsoft
  * MCSA: Office 365
  * MCSA: Server 2012
  * MCSA: Windows 8
  * MTA: Networking Fundamentals
  * Microsoft Certified Professional: License F513-9239

I have a beautiful wife who is an extremely gifted Psychologist and the amazing mother of my daughter. We are new to parenthood and it has been an great new adventure for us. We also have two dogs and a cat so things are pretty lively around here. When I am not spending time with the **fam**. I enjoy mountain biking, running and exploring.
