## Professional Interests

I am Alex Royster and I live in Denver, Colorado. I work at Mytech Partners, a Managed Service Provider. I am interested in all things IT and love learning about new technologies.

I manage servers, networks, storage, virtualization solutions and cloud platforms. I primarily work with Windows Servers managing Group Policy, Exchange, File Services and other domain functions. I also support various 3rd party server solutions and applications. Most servers I work with are virtualized on VMWare hosts, but I have a handful running on Hyper-V. Increasingly, I am supporting more Office 365 tenants, which has provided ample opportunity to brush up on PowerShell. Recently, I completed the Office 365 MCSA certification.

On the networking side, I administer primarily SonicWall, Cisco and Watchguard firewalls, routers and switches. With wireless networking in such high demand, I have become familiar with number of wireless access controllers including cloud managed solutions from Xirrus, Ubiquiti and Meraki and locally administered Cisco controllers.

I enjoy learning and am always working on new certifications. I am currently studying for the VMWare Certified Professional Datacenter Virtualization certification.
